Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Abstract:
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

## Variables Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- "subjectID" : An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 
- "activityID" : Its activity label.
- 66 Mean value and Standard deviation measurements of the following variables: 
  - tBodyAcc-XYZ : Triaxial estimated body acceleration (time)
  - tGravityAcc-XYZ : Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) (time)
  - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Jerk (time)
  - tBodyGyro-XYZ : Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope (time)
  - tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ : Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope Jerk (time)
  - tBodyAccMag : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Mag (time)
  - tGravityAccMag : Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) mag (time)
  - tBodyAccJerkMag : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Jerk Mag (time)
  - tBodyGyroMag : Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope Mag (time)
  - tBodyGyroJerkMag : Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope Jerk Mag (time)
  - fBodyAcc-XYZ :  Triaxial estimated body acceleration (frequency)
  - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Jerk (frequency)
  - fBodyGyro-XYZ : Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope (frequency)
  - fBodyAccMag : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Mag (frequency)
  - fBodyAccJerkMag : Triaxial estimated body acceleration Jerk Mag (frequency)
  - fBodyGyroMag :  Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope Mag (frequency)
  - fBodyGyroJerkMag :  Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope Jerk Mag (frequency)

## Training and Test sets:
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
